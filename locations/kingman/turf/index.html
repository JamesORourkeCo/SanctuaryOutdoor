        <h1>Artificial Turf (Synthetic Grass) in Kingman, AZ — installed to last and feel natural.</h1>
        <p>
          Turf is popular in Kingman because it looks great year-round and can last over a decade when installed correctly.
          The difference between "okay" and "excellent" is what's underneath: proper grading, a flat base, and the right infill.

          Artificial turf works well as a low-maintenance ground cover alternative to natural grass sod in desert xeriscaping. We coordinate turf installation with rock borders or decomposed granite base layers when combining ground cover types for complete yard solutions.

    <!-- WHY -->
    <section id="why">
      <h2 class="section-title">What makes turf work well in Kingman</h2>
      <p class="section-subtitle">
        Turf can be a smart, water-wise upgrade — especially when the turf area is intentionally defined, graded, and contained.

          <h3>1) Grade for drainage first</h3>
          <p>
            Before turf goes down, we grade the area so water drains properly. This helps prevent pooling under the turf
            and keeps monsoon runoff moving in the right direction. Proper base preparation follows the same drainage principles used for rock landscaping and sod installation—water management protects long-term performance regardless of ground cover type.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>2) Build a flat, natural-feel base</h3>
          <p>
            A quality base makes turf feel "right" underfoot. It also helps keep the surface smooth over time. We use crushed stone or decomposed granite base layers similar to those used in rock and gravel installations for stable, long-lasting results.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>3) Add a clean border</h3>
          <p>
            Borders keep turf crisp and contained. Many border choices work well in Kingman, including pavers and hardscape edges. Rock borders provide natural transitions between turf zones and decorative gravel areas.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>4) Choose the right turf type</h3>
          <p>
            Aside from color and texture, you may want pet turf. Pet turf is designed to drain more effectively and can stay more comfortable in direct sun.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>5) Pick the right infill</h3>
          <p>
            Infill keeps turf blades upright and gives them bounce. For pets, antimicrobial infill is an option that helps control odor and makes cleanup easier.

      <h2 class="section-title">Turf vs sod vs rock: choosing ground cover</h2>
      <p class="section-subtitle">
        Artificial turf, natural grass sod, and decorative rock each work well in Kingman when installed correctly.
      </p>
      <div class="card" style="max-width: 980px;">
        <p>
          When comparing turf or sod for your yard, consider water conservation and maintenance requirements. Artificial turf eliminates watering and mowing but requires quality base preparation using crushed stone layers. Natural grass sod provides environmental benefits but needs regular irrigation and maintenance. Decorative rock and gravel offer the lowest maintenance as ground cover alternatives, working well in xeriscaping designs or as borders around turf and sod zones.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top:1rem;">
          Many Kingman homeowners combine ground cover types—artificial turf in high-use play areas, natural grass sod in shaded zones, and rock borders or pathways connecting them. Each requires proper grading and drainage planning for long-term durability in desert conditions. We help you choose the right combination based on use patterns, water conservation goals, and maintenance preferences for your specific yard.

            Yes. We can design a <strong>dog-friendly turf</strong> area with drainage holes, easy-clean access,
            and an odor-control infill option if you have pets.

          <h3>Will turf drain during monsoon storms?</h3>
          <p>
            Turf only drains as well as what's under it. We grade the area to shed water, then install a compacted
            base so water flows the direction it's supposed to go.

          <h3>Do I need a border around turf?</h3>
          <p>
            Strongly recommended. Borders keep edges tight, protect against lifting, and create a clean transition
            to rock, concrete, or pavers.

          <h3>What does turf installation cost in Kingman?</h3>
          <p>
            Cost depends on square footage, access, existing soil conditions, and the turf system selected (standard vs.
            pet turf, infill type, and border choices). We'll quote it clearly before work begins.
