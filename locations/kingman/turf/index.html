        <h1>Artificial Turf (Synthetic Grass) in Kingman, AZ — installed to last and feel natural.</h1>
        <p>
          Turf is popular in Kingman because it looks great year-round and can last over a decade when installed correctly.
          The difference between “okay” and “excellent” is what’s underneath: proper grading, a flat base, and the right infill.

    <!-- WHY -->
    <section id="why">
      <h2 class="section-title">What makes turf work well in Kingman</h2>
      <p class="section-subtitle">
        Turf can be a smart, water-wise upgrade — especially when the turf area is intentionally defined, graded, and contained.
      </p>

      <!-- Desktop layout: card grid -->
      <div class="services-grid turf-desktop-only">
        <div class="card">
          <h3>1) Grade for drainage first</h3>
          <p>
            Before turf goes down, we grade the area so water drains properly. This helps prevent pooling under the turf
            and keeps monsoon runoff moving in the right direction.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>2) Build a flat, natural-feel base</h3>
          <p>
            A quality base makes turf feel “right” underfoot. It also helps keep the surface smooth over time.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>3) Add a clean border</h3>
          <p>
            Borders keep turf crisp and contained. Many border choices work well in Kingman, including pavers and hardscape edges.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>4) Choose the right turf type</h3>
          <p>
            Aside from color and texture, you may want pet turf. Pet turf is designed to drain more effectively and can stay more comfortable in direct sun.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>5) Pick the right infill</h3>
          <p>
            Infill helps turf fibers stand up so it doesn’t look like “high-traffic carpet.” For pets, antimicrobial infill is a must to reduce odor.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>6) Make it water-wise</h3>
          <p>
            Even with turf, grading and containment matter. We design the area so water goes where it should and doesn’t spread across the yard.

  <h2 class="section-title">Pet-Friendly Turf That Helps Keep Dirt Out of the House</h2>
  <p class="section-subtitle">
    A common Kingman search isn’t “solve drainage” — it’s “how do I stop my dogs from tracking dirt and mud inside?”
    Turf can be a clean, green solution when it’s installed on a properly graded base that drains.

  <h2 class="section-title">Turf Questions We Hear in Kingman</h2>

      <h3>How long does artificial turf last?</h3>
      <p>
        With the right base prep and installation, quality turf can look great for many years. We focus on
        proper grading, compaction, and edging — the details that make turf last.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Do you install pet turf for dogs?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes. We can design a <strong>dog-friendly turf</strong> area with drainage holes, easy-clean access,
        and an odor-control infill option if you have pets.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Will turf drain during monsoon storms?</h3>
      <p>
        Turf only drains as well as what’s under it. We grade the area to shed water, then install a compacted
        base so water flows the direction it’s supposed to go.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Do I need a border around turf?</h3>
      <p>
        Strongly recommended. Borders keep edges tight, protect against lifting, and create a clean transition
        to rock, concrete, or pavers.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>What does turf installation cost in Kingman?</h3>
      <p>
        Cost depends on square footage, access, existing soil conditions, and the turf system selected (standard vs.
        pet turf, infill type, and border choices). We’ll quote it clearly before work begins.
