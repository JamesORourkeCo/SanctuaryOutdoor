      <div class="card" style="max-width: 980px;">
        <p>
          Professional pergola installation begins with concrete footings sized for wind-rated anchoring and structural integrity. We coordinate footing depth and placement with your complete outdoor living plan—whether that includes concrete patios, flagstone walkways, or integrated hardscape design. This ensures proper drainage pitch across all surfaces, maintains finished height standards two inches below the stucco line, and protects long-term performance.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top:1rem;">
          Base preparation for pergola posts follows the same engineering principles as concrete slab work and flagstone installation. We plan for Kingman's desert heat cycles, establish proper water management for monsoon seasons, and coordinate with any concrete borders or natural stone transitions so your shade structure becomes part of a cohesive outdoor space rather than an isolated addition.

        </button>
        <div class="accordion-content">
          Yes. We coordinate concrete pads for stable foundation work or cut precise openings through flagstone so posts anchor to concrete footings below. This integration requires planning finished height across all surfaces, maintaining proper drainage flow, and ensuring water management works for both the patio area and covered zones. Base preparation follows the same principles whether we're setting posts on new concrete slabs or cutting through existing natural stone.
