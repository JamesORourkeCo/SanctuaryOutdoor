        <h2>What are sprinkler systems?</h2>
        <p>
          Sprinkler systems deliver water through spray heads or rotors to cover large lawn and turf areas efficiently. 
          Modern systems use <strong>zone control</strong> for different areas, <strong>matched precipitation rate 
          (MPR)</strong> heads for even coverage, and <strong>smart irrigation</strong> controllers with 
          <strong>evapotranspiration (ET)</strong> sensors for <strong>water conservation</strong> in 
          <strong>desert climate irrigation</strong>.

        Properly designed sprinkler systems provide <strong>water-efficient irrigation</strong> for lawns and turf

        <div>
          <h3>Benefits of Modern Sprinkler Systems</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Even coverage:</strong> <strong>Matched precipitation rate (MPR)</strong> heads apply water 
            uniformly regardless of spray pattern or spacing.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Zone control:</strong> Separate <strong>control valves</strong> allow different lawn areas 
            to run on optimal schedules for sun exposure and soil type.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Smart irrigation:</strong> <strong>Evapotranspiration (ET) controllers</strong> adjust 
            watering based on weather, temperature, and <strong>seasonal water management</strong> needs.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Automated scheduling:</strong> <strong>Irrigation timers</strong> and <strong>irrigation 
            controllers</strong> enable hands-free operation with <strong>monsoon-ready irrigation</strong> 
            adjustments.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Water conservation:</strong> Modern systems <strong>reduce water waste</strong> through 
            proper <strong>pressure management</strong>, rain sensors, and optimized run times.

              <h3>What is MPR?</h3>
              <p>
                <strong>Matched Precipitation Rate (MPR)</strong> means all sprinkler heads in a zone apply water 
                at the same rate (inches per hour) regardless of their spacing or spray pattern.
              </p>
              <p style="margin-top:0.8rem;">
                <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Traditional heads apply water unevenly—a 180° half-circle head 
                puts down twice as much water as a 360° full-circle head in the same time. This creates dry spots 
                and overwatered areas.
              </p>
              <p style="margin-top:0.8rem;">
                <strong>MPR solution:</strong> MPR heads adjust their flow rate based on coverage area, ensuring 
                every part of the lawn gets the same amount of water. This is critical for <strong>water 
                conservation</strong> and <strong>year-round watering efficiency</strong>.

              <h3>Smart Irrigation with ET Technology</h3>
              <p>
                <strong>Evapotranspiration (ET)</strong> is the amount of water lost through soil evaporation 
                and plant transpiration. <strong>Smart irrigation</strong> controllers use ET data to automatically 
                adjust watering schedules.
              </p>
              <p style="margin-top:0.8rem;">
                <strong>How it works:</strong> Controllers monitor temperature, humidity, wind, and solar radiation 
                to calculate daily water needs. During hot, dry periods, run times increase. During cool or rainy 
                periods, they decrease or pause entirely.
              </p>
              <p style="margin-top:0.8rem;">
                <strong>Benefits:</strong> Automatic <strong>seasonal water management</strong>, <strong>monsoon 
                season</strong> adjustments, reduced water bills, healthier lawns (no over/under watering), and 
                significant <strong>water conservation</strong> (typically 20-40% savings).

                <p>
                  Different lawn areas have different water needs based on sun exposure, soil type, slope, and 
                  plant material. <strong>Zone control</strong> allows each area to run on its optimal schedule.

                <p>
                  <strong>Sun exposure:</strong> South-facing slopes need more water than shaded areas<br>
                  <strong>Soil type:</strong> <strong>Sandy soil irrigation</strong> requires shorter, more 
                  frequent cycles; <strong>clay soil watering</strong> needs longer, less frequent cycles<br>
                  <strong>Coverage:</strong> Each zone limited by water pressure and flow capacity

              <div class="card">
                <h3>Control Valves</h3>
                <p>
                  Each zone has its own <strong>control valve</strong> wired to the <strong>irrigation controller</strong>. 
                  This enables independent scheduling and <strong>pressure management</strong> for optimal head performance.

                <h3>Why Pressure Matters</h3>
                <p>
                  Household water pressure (50-70 PSI) is often too high for sprinkler heads. Excessive pressure 
                  causes misting (water evaporates before reaching ground), uneven coverage, and premature head wear.
                </p>
                <p style="margin-top:0.8rem;">
                  Low pressure causes short throw distance and poor coverage overlap.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div class="card">
                <h3>Pressure Regulation</h3>
                <p>
                  <strong>Pressure regulators</strong> maintain optimal PSI (typically 30-50 PSI for rotor heads, 
                  20-30 PSI for spray heads). This ensures proper head performance, <strong>efficient water 
                  delivery</strong>, and <strong>water conservation</strong> through reduced misting and 
                  <strong>evaporation reduction</strong>.

              <p>
                <strong>Backflow preventers</strong> are required by code for all in-ground irrigation systems. 
                They prevent irrigation water (which may contain fertilizers, pesticides, or soil contaminants) 
                from flowing back into the potable water supply.

              <p style="margin-top:0.8rem;">
                <strong>Types:</strong> Pressure vacuum breaker (PVB) or reduced pressure zone (RPZ) devices, 
                installed above ground near water source. Annual testing may be required by local jurisdiction.
              </p>
              <p style="margin-top:0.8rem;">
                All <strong>professional irrigation installation</strong> projects include proper backflow 
                prevention devices per local codes.

                <strong>Rotor heads</strong> cover 15-50 feet with a rotating stream, applying water slowly 
                (0.4-0.6 in/hr)—ideal for large lawns. <strong>Spray heads</strong> cover 4-15 feet with a 
                fixed pattern, applying water faster (1.5-2.0 in/hr)—best for small areas and flowerbeds.

                <strong>MPR technology</strong> ensures all heads in a zone apply water at the same rate 
                (inches/hour) regardless of spray pattern or spacing. This prevents dry spots and overwatered 
                areas, improving <strong>water conservation</strong> and lawn health.

                <strong>Evapotranspiration (ET) controllers</strong> are <strong>smart irrigation</strong> 
                systems that automatically adjust watering based on weather, temperature, and humidity. They 
                provide <strong>seasonal water management</strong>, <strong>monsoon season</strong> pausing, 
                and typically save 20-40% on water bills while improving lawn health.

                Zone count depends on lawn size, water pressure, sun exposure, and soil type. <strong>Zone 
                control</strong> allows different areas to run on optimal schedules. We calculate zones based 
                on your property's specific conditions for even coverage and <strong>water-efficient irrigation</strong>.

                <strong>Backflow preventers</strong> protect your potable water supply from contamination by 
                preventing irrigation water (which may contain fertilizers or soil contaminants) from flowing

                Yes. If your <strong>irrigation controller</strong> has open ports, we can wire in additional 
                zones. If all ports are used, we can upgrade to a larger controller. Zone expansion is common 
                when adding new lawn areas or converting existing zones.
