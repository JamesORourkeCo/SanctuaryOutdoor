<h1>Sprinkler Systems for Sod and Lawn Zones in Kingman</h1>
<p>Sprinkler systems are ideal for watering larger areas like <strong>sod and natural grass</strong> in Kingman. We install and repair irrigation zones, add anti-siphon/backflow protection, tune pressure, and set valves and heads for even coverage without waste.</p>
<p>
          Your lawn needs a different amount of water than small plants. We trench and install plumbing to reach each pop up
          sprinkler head, and we use adjustable heads so height can be tuned if sod changes over time. Ask for a demonstration.
        </p>
<p>
          Designed for pets, kids, and desert conditions.

<h2 class="section-title">How we build sprinkler systems in Kingman</h2>
<p class="section-subtitle">
        Our process focuses on water control, reliable coverage, and easy maintenance.
      </p>
<div class="grid">
<div class="card">
<h3>1) Zone planning</h3>
<p>
            We determine how many zones are required so lawn and plant areas get the right amount of water.
          </p>
</div>
<div class="card">
<h3>2) Protection and pressure control</h3>
<p>
            Anti siphon devices and pressure reducers protect the system and avoid sprinkler misting or blowout.
          </p>
</div>
<div class="card">
<h3>3) Valve and timer wiring</h3>
<p>
            One valve per zone, wired into open timer ports when available for clean automation.
          </p>
</div>
<div class="card">
<h3>4) Trenching and head setup</h3>
<p>
            We trench lines and install pop up sprinklers with adjustable height for future sod changes.

<div class="accordion-item">
<button aria-expanded="false" class="accordion-button" type="button">
<span>How many zones do I need for a sod lawn?</span>
<span>+</span>
</button>
<div class="accordion-content">
          Zone count depends on lawn size, water pressure, and sun exposure. We calculate zones so coverage is even and efficient.
        </div>
</div>
<div class="accordion-item">
<button aria-expanded="false" class="accordion-button" type="button">
<span>Do you install anti siphon protection?</span>
<span>+</span>
</button>
<div class="accordion-content">
          Yes. Anti siphon devices prevent backpressure issues and protect the water supply.
        </div>
</div>
<div class="accordion-item">
<button aria-expanded="false" class="accordion-button" type="button">
<span>Can pop up sprinkler heads be adjusted later?</span>
<span>+</span>
</button>
<div class="accordion-content">
          Yes. Adjustable heads let us raise or lower height as sod settles or grows.
        </div>
</div>
<div class="accordion-item">
<button aria-expanded="false" class="accordion-button" type="button">
<span>Can you connect new zones to my existing timer?</span>
<span>+</span>
</button>
<div class="accordion-content">
          If there are open ports we can wire in. If not, we recommend the right timer upgrade.
