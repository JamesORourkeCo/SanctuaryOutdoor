Why Choose Tall Fescue Sod?

<span class="accordion-arrow">›</span>
</button>
<div class="accordion-body">
<p>Tall fescue is readily available locally and is the most popular choice for adding a lush, living accent to a yard in Kingman and Northwest Arizona. It provides excellent heat tolerance and moderate water needs suitable for the high-desert climate.</p>

<div class="accordion">
<button class="accordion-header" type="button">
<span class="accordion-title">Do I need to remove old grass before installing sod?</span>
<span class="accordion-arrow">›</span>
</button>
<div class="accordion-body">
<p>Yes, removing old grass down to the bare dirt is necessary for proper root establishment. We till the soil, add topsoil if needed, and grade the area to be flat before laying sod, starting along a straight edge for the best results.</p>

<div class="accordion">
<button class="accordion-header" type="button">
<span class="accordion-title">How do you keep sod water-wise?</span>
<span class="accordion-arrow">›</span>
</button>
<div class="accordion-body">
<p>We recommend bordering (edging) the sod so water stays contained to the lawn zone. With proper grading, this helps reduce water waste and improves performance. Dedicated irrigation zones with matched sprinkler heads prevent overspray and ensure efficient watering.</p>

<div class="accordion">
<button class="accordion-header" type="button">
<span class="accordion-title">How long do I water my newly laid sod?</span>
<span class="accordion-arrow">›</span>
</button>
<div class="accordion-body">
<p>Keep the soil surface moist for the first three weeks. Water at least once a day (or more in hot weather) for the first two weeks. This ensures proper root growth and establishment. We'll provide detailed watering instructions specific to your installation.</p>

<button class="accordion-header" type="button">
<span class="accordion-title">When can I mow new sod?</span>
<span class="accordion-arrow">›</span>
</button>
<div class="accordion-body">
<p>Wait until the grass is rooted, typically around 2–3 weeks, and never remove more than one-third of the grass blade. This allows the roots to establish properly before subjecting the lawn to mowing stress.</p>

<span class="accordion-title">Is sod a good investment for my property?</span>
<span class="accordion-arrow">›</span>
</button>
<div class="accordion-body">
<p>Yes, sod provides an instant lawn, prevents erosion, and increases property value significantly in just a few hours. Unlike seeding, which takes months, sod creates an immediate, usable outdoor space that's ready for families and pets within weeks.</p>

<span class="accordion-title">Will sod help reduce dirt tracked into the house by pets and kids?</span>
<span class="accordion-arrow">›</span>
</button>
<div class="accordion-body">
<p>Often, yes—especially when a small sod accent is placed near the patio or play zone. A clean, bordered sod area can reduce loose dust and 'dirt feet' compared to bare soil. Sod establishes quickly, creating a durable surface for families and pets within just a few weeks.</p>
