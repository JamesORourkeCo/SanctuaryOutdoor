        <p>
          There are many types of irrigation. Most homeowners choose drip or full sprinklers, but the middle option is
          mini bubbler irrigation. It connects to a 1/4 inch line like a drip fitting and delivers enough flow for trees
          and large plants without the harsh rush of a full bubbler system.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are an irrigation contractor in Kingman who handles irrigation repair Kingman AZ, irrigation installation Kingman AZ,
          and irrigation retrofit Kingman projects. If your yard irrigation Kingman AZ zones are watering wrong plants,
          we can correct the fittings and run times to stop plants getting too much water and avoid unnecessarily high water bills.

          <h3>High water bills</h3>
