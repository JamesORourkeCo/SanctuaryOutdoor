        <p>
          Kingman sees big temperature swings and direct sun that can push surface temperatures over 140 degrees.
          Concrete needs the right base, drainage pitch, and reinforcement to last. We build slabs for patios,
          walkways, RV pads, and shed floors with a plan for heat, water, and weight.

      <h2 class="section-title">Concrete planning for Kingman homes</h2>
      <p class="section-subtitle">
        We design concrete patios, walkways, and slabs to handle desert heat cycles and heavy loads, while keeping water
        moving away from your home and toward proper drainage.

        </button>
        <div class="accordion-content">
          We start with how the concrete will be used. A backyard patio has different load requirements than an RV pad
          or a concrete slab for a shed. This determines thickness, reinforcement, and base prep.

          Concrete must be pitched to move water away from the home and set two inches below the stucco line.

        </button>
        <div class="accordion-content">
          We remove soil to make room for road base, then compact for a stable foundation. Concrete is not poured directly
          on soil. This step protects against cracking in Kingman heat cycles.

          Depending on the job, we use rebar, wire mesh, fiber, or additives for strength. Concrete is a cement and aggregate

          We install stamped concrete Kingman AZ, broom finish concrete, and stained concrete. When matching older pavers,
          stamped and stained finishes can recreate color and pattern without special-order delays. Stamped concrete transitions smoothly to flagstone borders for integrated hardscape design. When outdoor living spaces include pergola shade structures, we coordinate concrete footings during the pour to ensure proper anchoring and wind ratings.

      <h2 class="section-title">Drainage-aware concrete design</h2>
      <p class="section-subtitle">
        Concrete should not trap water. We plan slab edges, grading, and drainage so monsoon runoff has a path out of the yard.
      </p>
      <div class="card" style="max-width: 980px;">
        <p>
          Many yards end up with wall-to-wall concrete that blocks drainage. When we see that risk, we recommend a drainage
          path or drain pipe under slabs to keep water moving.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top:1rem;">
          Concrete base preparation follows the same drainage principles whether supporting flagstone surfaces or serving as foundation anchoring for pergola posts. We plan finished height, pitch away from the home, and proper grading so all hardscape elements work together for long-term performance in Kingman's desert heat cycles.
