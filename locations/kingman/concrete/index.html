          Kingman sees big temperature swings and direct sun that can push surface temperatures over 140 degrees.
          Concrete needs the right base, drainage pitch, and reinforcement to last. We build slabs for patios,
          walkways, RV pads, and shed floors with a plan for heat, water, and weight.

        We design concrete patios, walkways, and slabs to handle desert heat cycles and heavy loads, while keeping water

        <div class="accordion-content">
          We start with how the concrete will be used. A backyard patio has different load requirements than an RV pad
          or a concrete slab for a shed. This determines thickness, reinforcement, and base prep.

          Concrete must be pitched to move water away from the home and set two inches below the stucco line.

          We remove soil to make room for road base, then compact for a stable foundation. Concrete is not poured directly

          Depending on the job, we use rebar, wire mesh, fiber, or additives for strength. Concrete is a cement and aggregate

        Concrete should not trap water. We plan slab edges, grading, and drainage so monsoon runoff has a path out of the yard.

        <p>
          Many yards end up with wall-to-wall concrete that blocks drainage. When we see that risk, we recommend a drainage
          path or drain pipe under slabs to keep water moving.
