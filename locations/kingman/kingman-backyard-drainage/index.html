        <p>
          When monsoon rain hits hard, “almost flat” yards can turn into ponds. The fix usually isn’t more gravel or
          another patch — it’s a <strong>grading and drainage plan</strong> that routes water where it belongs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sanctuary Outdoor uses high-fidelity <strong>3D renderings</strong> to show the plan before construction begins —
          with <strong>clear pricing</strong> before you commit.

    <section id="why">
      <h2 class="section-title">Why yards flood in Kingman</h2>
      <p class="section-subtitle">
        Flooding is usually a combination of surface flow, hard surfaces, and small grade changes that push water into the wrong place.
      </p>

      <div class="services-grid">
        <div class="card">
          <h3>1) Flat or negative grading</h3>
          <p>When the yard is flat — or slopes toward your patio, wall, or foundation — water collects fast and has nowhere to go.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>2) Monsoon storms</h3>
          <p>Monsoon downpours can overwhelm yards in minutes. The goal is to route water away from structures before it turns into standing water.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>3) Hard surfaces concentrate runoff</h3>
          <p>Roof lines, patios, and paths funnel water into low spots. Without a defined exit path, it pools against walls and slabs.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>4) Soil conditions reduce absorption</h3>
          <p>Compacted soil (and caliche in many areas) can limit infiltration — making surface flow management even more important.</p>

        The right fix usually combines grading, routing, and build details — planned together.

      <div class="services-grid">
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Grading correction</h3>
          <p>Adjust slopes so water moves away from patios, walls, and foundations — not toward them.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Defined flow paths</h3>
          <p>Create intentional routing so water has a predictable, safe direction during heavy rain.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Drainage integration</h3>
          <p>Design drainage features that fit the yard (and the look), not a last-minute patch after the build.</p>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>3D plan + clear pricing</h3>
