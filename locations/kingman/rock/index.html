      <h2 class="section-title">Ground cover alternatives for desert yards</h2>
      <p class="section-subtitle">
        Rock and gravel landscaping is one of several ground cover options for low-maintenance desert yards in Kingman.
      </p>
      <div class="card" style="max-width: 980px;">
        <p>
          Decorative rock works well as a stand-alone ground cover or combined with other materials. We often coordinate rock borders around sod installation zones or provide crushed stone base layers for artificial turf projects. Each ground cover type—natural grass, artificial turf, or rock and gravel—requires proper base preparation and drainage planning for durability in Kingman's desert climate.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top:1rem;">
          When comparing rock vs turf or sod, consider maintenance requirements and water conservation goals. Rock and gravel require minimal ongoing maintenance once installed correctly, while natural grass sod needs regular watering and mowing. Artificial turf eliminates watering but requires different base preparation. We help homeowners choose the right ground cover alternative or combination based on use patterns, budget, and long-term durability needs for each yard zone.
