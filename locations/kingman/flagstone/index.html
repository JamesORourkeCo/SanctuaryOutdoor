          We are about 40 miles from Ash Fork, Arizona, a major flagstone source. That means better access to colors and
          larger pieces for your patio or walkway. We plan the finished height, base, and drainage so the stone surface
          looks great and performs through monsoon seasons.

          Flagstone installation requires the same drainage planning as concrete patios—proper pitch, base preparation, and finished height two inches below the stucco line. When outdoor living spaces include pergola shade structures, we coordinate footing placement with stone layout for integrated hardscape design.

      <h2 class="section-title">Flagstone installation details</h2>
      <p class="section-subtitle">
        Flagstone is thick, heavy, and needs a proper base. We plan depth, pitch, and drainage before laying stone so
        water flows away from the home and the surface stays even.

        </button>
        <div class="accordion-content">
          The top of the stone should sit about two inches below the stucco line. We remove soil, set base material,
          and adjust thickness so the flagstone surface is level and consistent.

        </button>
        <div class="accordion-content">
          We pitch the base to move water away from the home. If needed, we install drain pipe under the flagstone
          so runoff exits the yard instead of pooling.

        <div class="accordion-content">
          Gaps can be filled with sand, fine material, or structural grout depending on the desired look and use.
          We can also top-dress with finer material for a natural finish. Joint treatment affects water management and long-term durability. Structural grout provides the most stable surface for heavy use areas and works well when transitioning flagstone to concrete borders or establishing foundation anchoring points for outdoor structures.

          <span>+</span>
        </button>
        <div class="accordion-content">
          If you want a pergola or gazebo on the stone surface, we place concrete footings before stone installation and cut precise openings so posts anchor properly. This ensures wind-rated anchoring and structural support that meets manufacturer specifications for shade structures. Footing depth is coordinated with base preparation to maintain proper drainage pitch across the entire patio area.

        <p>
          We plan flagstone surfaces alongside concrete base work and pergola footings so everything shares the same drainage pitch, finished height standards, and structural integrity. This coordination ensures natural stone patios integrate smoothly with concrete borders, proper foundation anchoring for shade structures, and water management that protects your home during Kingman's monsoon seasons.

          Base preparation follows consistent principles whether we're setting flagstone on compacted road base, pouring concrete footings for wind-rated pergola posts, or establishing proper grading for long-term performance in desert heat cycles.
