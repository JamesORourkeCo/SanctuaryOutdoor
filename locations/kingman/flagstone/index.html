        <p>
          We are about 40 miles from Ash Fork, Arizona, a major flagstone source. That means better access to colors and
          larger pieces for your patio or walkway. We plan the finished height, base, and drainage so the stone surface
          looks great and performs through monsoon seasons.

      <p class="section-subtitle">
        Flagstone is thick, heavy, and needs a proper base. We plan depth, pitch, and drainage before laying stone so
        water flows away from the home and the surface stays even.

        </button>
        <div class="accordion-content">
          The top of the stone should sit about two inches below the stucco line. We remove soil, set base material,
          and adjust thickness so the flagstone surface is level and consistent.

        </button>
        <div class="accordion-content">
          We pitch the base to move water away from the home. If needed, we install drain pipe under the flagstone
          so runoff exits the yard instead of pooling.

        <div class="accordion-content">
          Gaps can be filled with sand, fine material, or structural grout depending on the desired look and use.
          We can also top-dress with finer material for a natural finish.

          If you want a pergola or gazebo on the stone surface, we place footings before stone installation and cut
