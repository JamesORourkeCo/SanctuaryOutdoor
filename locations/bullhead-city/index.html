          <p class="section-subtitle">
            Bullhead City combines tract neighborhoods, hillside views, and proximity to the Colorado River.
            Many properties have mixed grading, walls, and hardscape that weren’t originally planned with
            long-term drainage or outdoor living in mind. Our work goes beyond surface-level landscaping
            to address layout, drainage, and structural performance.
          </p>

          <p style="font-size:0.9rem;color:#4b5563;">Homeowners who choose Sanctuary Outdoor typically want:</p>

    <!-- KEY TECHNICAL TOPICS (ACCORDION) -->
    <section>
      <h2 class="section-title">How we design for Bullhead City conditions</h2>
      <p class="section-subtitle">
        Below are some of the engineering and planning considerations that go into a typical Bullhead City outdoor
        living project. The overview stays simple on the surface—details are here when you want them.
      </p>

      <div class="accordion-group">

        <!-- Drainage -->
        <div class="accordion-item">
          <button class="accordion-header" type="button">
            <span class="label">Drainage & grading in Bullhead City</span>
            <span class="icon">›</span>
          </button>

          <div class="accordion-content">
            <div class="accordion-inner">
              <p>
                We begin by understanding your property, your inspiration, and how you want to use the space.
                In Bullhead City, that also means looking closely at how your lot fits into the surrounding
                neighborhood grading and existing hardscape.
              </p>

              <p><strong>Mixed grading & neighborhood drainage patterns</strong></p>
              <p>
                Many Bullhead City homes sit in established neighborhoods where driveways, patios, and walkways
                were added over time—changing how water moves during monsoon storms or heavy rain.
              </p>

              <p>
                We review key elevations using a level-based approach so we can identify where water wants to go,
                how it interacts with walls and hardscape, and whether simple grading adjustments, swales, or
                drains can improve performance.
              </p>

              <p>
                Our goal is to integrate drainage considerations into the design from day one, so the finished
                outdoor space not only looks cohesive but also manages water realistically.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Wind / Structural -->
        <div class="accordion-item">
          <button class="accordion-header" type="button">
            <span class="label">Structural safety for high-wind conditions</span>
            <span class="icon">›</span>
          </button>

          <div class="accordion-content">
            <div class="accordion-inner">
              <p>
                Bullhead City and nearby river communities can experience strong straight-line winds and sudden
                storm events that place real stress on outdoor structures. Because these events occur without
                warning, structural safety becomes just as important as aesthetics.
              </p>

              <p>
                At Sanctuary Outdoor, every pergola, gazebo, and patio bar is designed with high-wind performance
                in mind—even when the item does not require a building permit.
              </p>

              <p><strong>Our wind-resilience standards include:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>Engineered-style footings sized for local wind conditions</li>
                <li>Structural anchoring using high-grade connectors and fasteners</li>
                <li>Selection of products with verified high-wind ratings where applicable</li>
                <li>Installation practices that follow local codes and best standards</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                Our goal is simple: design outdoor structures that remain beautiful, functional, and safe—
                even during severe wind events common in the Bullhead City region.

                Our work in Bullhead City follows a dual-phase visualization and documentation process—
                3D concepts for clarity and 2D architectural plans for precision.
              </p>

              <p><strong>Phase 1: 3D concept design</strong></p>
              <p>
                We create photo-realistic 3D images that give you a true visual preview of your future outdoor
                space. You’ll see materials, textures, lighting, spatial flow, and how each element relates to
                your home and surroundings.
              </p>

              <p><strong>Phase 2: Architectural 2D plans</strong></p>
              <p>
                Once the 3D design is approved, we produce proportional 2D drawings with dimensions, areas,
                construction notes, and layout details. These are used for pricing, construction guidance,
                and permit documentation when required.

              <p><strong>1️⃣ Discovery</strong></p>
              <p>
                We evaluate your property, inspiration, and goals. In Bullhead City, this includes lot slope,
                drainage movement, sun path, wind conditions, privacy, and views.
              </p>

              <p><strong>2️⃣ 3D concept design</strong></p>
              <p>
                We translate discovery findings into photo-realistic 3D concepts—giving you something tangible
                to react to before moving forward.
              </p>

              <p><strong>3️⃣ Investment alignment</strong></p>
              <p>
                Your proposal is based directly on the approved 3D concept. We define scope clearly to eliminate
                scope creep and ensure transparency.
              </p>

              <p><strong>4️⃣ Architectural 2D plans</strong></p>
              <p>
                These drawings dial in accurate pricing, direct crews, and support permit packages when needed.
              </p>

              <p><strong>5️⃣ Design–build management</strong></p>
              <p>
                We oversee the full build to ensure the final product matches the approved 3D renderings and
                architectural plans.

                We don’t provide vague ranges—we provide a clear, accurate proposal based on your approved 3D
                concept and the 2D drawings that follow.
              </p>
              <p>
                We design your project, or phases of your project, to fit within your budget.
                Every proposal includes exact scope, materials, and clearly defined expectations.
              </p>
              <p>
                You are welcome to refine features or adjust phasing. If changes impact cost or design flow,
                we explain that upfront.

                We provide a realistic timeline for every project. Weather is the main variable—monsoon storms,
                wind, and wet ground can impact on-site safety.
              </p>
              <p>
                When delays occur, we communicate proactively and resume as soon as safe.

              <p>Yes — pool-focused outdoor living is a major part of our design work.</p>
              <p>
                When needed, we coordinate drawings and layout details with pool builders so everything is aligned
                for permits, pricing, and construction accuracy.

            <div class="faq-inner">
              <p>
                Often, yes. If the issue can be addressed through grading adjustments, swales, or integrated design,
                we include solutions as part of the plan.
              </p>
              <p>
                If a situation involves neighborhood grading constraints or structural limitations, we will be
                transparent about what is feasible.
