<!-- WHY BULLHEAD CITY HOMEOWNERS CHOOSE US -->
<section>
<h2 class="section-title">Why Bullhead City homeowners choose Sanctuary Outdoor</h2>
<div class="two-col">
<div>
<p class="section-subtitle">
  Bullhead City combines tract neighborhoods, hillside views, and proximity to the Colorado River.
  Many properties have mixed grading, walls, and hardscape that weren't originally planned with
  long-term drainage or outdoor living in mind. Our work goes beyond surface-level landscaping
  to address layout, drainage, and structural performance.
</p>
<p style="font-size:0.9rem;color:#4b5563;">Homeowners who choose Sanctuary Outdoor typically want:</p>
<ul style="font-size:0.9rem;color:#4b5563;padding-left:1.1rem;">
<li>Photo-realistic 3D concepts before any construction</li>
<li>Accurate, clearly defined project proposals—no scope creep</li>
<li>Drainage solutions that work with existing lots and neighborhood grading</li>
<li>Pergolas and structures designed for local winds and sudden storms</li>
<li>Architectural 2D drawings for pricing, layout, and coordination</li>
<li>One team to carry the design vision through to the final build</li>
</ul>

<div class="highlight-card">
<strong>At a glance: what's different about us</strong>

<!-- KEY TECHNICAL TOPICS (ACCORDION) -->
<section>
<h2 class="section-title">How we design for Bullhead City conditions</h2>
<p class="section-subtitle">
  Below are some of the engineering and planning considerations that go into a typical Bullhead City outdoor
  living project. The overview stays simple on the surface—details are here when you want them.
</p>
<div class="accordion-group">
<!-- Drainage -->
<div class="accordion-item">
<button class="accordion-header" type="button">
<span class="label">Drainage &amp; grading in Bullhead City</span>
<span class="icon">›</span>
</button>
<div class="accordion-content">
<div class="accordion-inner">
<p>
  Bullhead City has a variety of lot types—some nearly flat, others with slopes or walls that create
  unique drainage patterns. We evaluate how water flows across your property during typical rain and
  storm events, then integrate grading adjustments, swales, or drainage features into the design.
</p>
<p>
  The goal is to prevent water from pooling near your home or outdoor structures and to route it
  away from low spots. We coordinate with existing yard layouts, neighborhood grading, and utility
  locations so solutions work long-term.
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<!-- Wind structures -->
<div class="accordion-item">
<button class="accordion-header" type="button">
<span class="label">Wind-rated pergolas and shade systems</span>
<span class="icon">›</span>
</button>
<div class="accordion-content">
<div class="accordion-inner">
<p>
  Bullhead City can experience sudden wind events and strong gusts. We recommend pergolas and shade
  structures that meet manufacturer wind ratings and install them with appropriate footings and fastening.
</p>
<p>
  When needed, we prepare footing details showing depth, diameter, and attachment methods to ensure
  structures are safe and warranties remain valid.
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<!-- Pool coordination -->
<div class="accordion-item">
<button class="accordion-header" type="button">
<span class="label">Pool-centric outdoor living layout</span>
<span class="icon">›</span>
</button>
<div class="accordion-content">
<div class="accordion-inner">
<p>
  Many Bullhead City projects include custom pools. We coordinate with your pool builder to ensure
  decking, grading, outdoor kitchens, fire features, and seating areas align with pool placement and
  equipment locations.
</p>
<p>
  Our 3D designs and 2D architectural drawings show how all elements connect spatially, which helps
  with pricing, permitting, and contractor coordination.
