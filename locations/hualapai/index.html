      <h2 class="section-title">Why Hualapai homeowners choose Sanctuary Outdoor</h2>
      <div class="two-col">
        <div>
          <p class="section-subtitle">
            Hualapai Mountain communities sit at higher elevations than Kingman valley neighborhoods. Properties
            often feature hillside terrain, natural drainage patterns, cooler microclimates, and mountain views.
            These conditions require drainage-aware planning, elevation-appropriate landscaping, and structures
            designed for mountain wind and weather.
          </p>
          <p style="font-size:0.9rem;color:#4b5563;">
            Homeowners who choose Sanctuary Outdoor typically want:
          </p>
          <ul style="font-size:0.9rem;color:#4b5563;padding-left:1.1rem;">
            <li>Photo-realistic 3D concepts showing their hillside space before any construction</li>
            <li>Accurate proposals with clearly defined scope and transparent pricing</li>
            <li>Hillside drainage solutions that prevent erosion and protect structures</li>
            <li>Plant and material selections appropriate for higher elevation conditions</li>
            <li>Wind-resilient pergolas and outdoor structures engineered for mountain weather</li>
            <li>One team managing design and build from start to finish</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3 style="font-size:1.2rem;margin-bottom:0.6rem;">Designed for mountain conditions</h3>
          <p style="font-size:0.9rem;color:#4b5563;">
            Our 3D renderings show exact materials, lighting, spatial relationships, and how your outdoor
            space integrates with hillside terrain. We combine visual clarity with architectural 2D drawings
            that define grading, drainage routes, and structural details.
          </p>
          <p style="font-size:0.9rem;color:#4b5563;margin-top:0.8rem;">
            The result is a predictable process with accurate pricing, realistic timelines, and outdoor
            living spaces that work with—not against—Hualapai's elevation and climate.
