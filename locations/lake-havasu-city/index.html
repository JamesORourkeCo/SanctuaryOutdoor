            Lake Havasu City brings a unique combination of waterfront living, desert climate,
            steep elevation transitions, and extreme heat. Many homes sit on sloped lots with
            retaining walls, engineered pads, and narrow side yards—requiring careful design beyond
            basic landscaping standards.

    <section>
      <h2 class="section-title">How we design for Lake Havasu City conditions</h2>
      <p class="section-subtitle">
        Below are technical planning considerations that commonly influence outdoor living projects
        in Lake Havasu City—including heat, wind, drainage, and hillside lot engineering.
      </p>

      <div class="accordion-group">
        <!-- DRAINAGE & ELEVATION -->
        <div class="accordion-item">
          <button class="accordion-header" type="button">
            <span class="label">Drainage &amp; elevation mapping for hillside lots</span>
            <span class="icon">›</span>
          </button>
          <div class="accordion-content">
            <div class="accordion-inner">
              <p>
                Many Lake Havasu City homes are built on engineered pads with steep slopes behind or
                beside the property. This affects how water moves, how retaining walls handle runoff,
                and how new hardscape changes existing drainage patterns.
              </p>

              <p><strong>Common LHC drainage challenges:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>Runoff traveling from uphill properties directly into backyards</li>
                <li>Retaining walls that create trapped low points after heavy rain</li>
                <li>Side yards with insufficient fall for proper flow</li>
                <li>Sloped driveways that push stormwater toward the home</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                Our elevation measurements identify where water naturally moves, how the lot was engineered,
                and what adjustments prevent flooding, pooling, or erosion. Drainage is integrated from day
                one—ensuring your outdoor living space performs as well as it looks.

              <p>
                Lake Havasu City experiences long-lasting wind events strong enough to stress
                pergolas, patio covers, and masonry walls. Many shade structures fail because
                they were installed without proper anchoring or engineering.
              </p>

              <p><strong>Our structural standards include:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>Engineered-style footings sized for local wind load</li>
                <li>High-grade steel connectors and uplift-resistant anchors</li>

                <li>Architectural drawings for structures requiring permits</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                Whether it's an aluminum pergola, steel shade structure, or custom bar roof,
                our priority is long-term performance in harsh weather.

              <p><strong>Phase 1 — 3D Concept Design</strong></p>
              <p>
                We create photo-realistic 3D images showing the complete outdoor environment—shade, lighting,
                textures, nighttime views, and how the layout flows with your home and hillside surroundings.

              <p><strong>Phase 2 — Architectural 2D Drawings</strong></p>
              <p>
                After the 3D design is approved, we produce architectural-grade 2D plans that include:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>Proportional layout diagrams</li>
                <li>Dimensions and area calculations</li>
                <li>Drainage patterns and elevations</li>
                <li>Structural notes and material callouts</li>
              </ul>

              </p>

              <p><strong>3️⃣ Investment Alignment</strong></p>
              <p>We match the design to your budget using a detailed scope—no vague allowances, no surprises.</p>

              <p><strong>4️⃣ Architectural Plans</strong></p>

                Yes. Lake Havasu City is one of our primary western Arizona markets. We design and manage
                projects across the city—including hillside communities, lake-view properties, and
                master-planned neighborhoods.

              <p>Absolutely. Pool-centric backyards are one of the most common project types in Lake Havasu City.</p>
              <p>
                Depending on the neighborhood and the scale of the project, some pool builds require
                engineered drawings, electrical documentation, and site plans. We can prepare these documents
                when needed.

                Often, yes. Many drainage issues stem from poor grading, insufficient slope, trapped
                low points behind retaining walls, or runoff from uphill properties.
              </p>
              <p>
                If the issue can be solved with grading adjustments, swales, drains, or elevation planning,
                we will propose a practical solution.
              </p>
              <p>
                If the drainage problem is structural or geological in nature, we will be direct about
                whether it is a project we can safely take on.

                Yes. We select pergola and shade structure models that are appropriate for strong desert winds
                and install them according to engineered or manufacturer specifications.

              <p>
                Larger structures, or those placed near property lines, may require permit drawings. We produce
                these drawings in-house.
