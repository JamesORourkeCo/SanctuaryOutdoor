        <h1>Lake Havasu City Landscape Design & Outdoor Living Spaces</h1>
        <p>
          Sanctuary Outdoor provides high-end 3D landscape design and outdoor living concepts serving Lake Havasu City, Kingman, Bullhead City, and surrounding northwest Arizona communities. We use photo-realistic 3D images so you can accurately preview your future outdoor space before construction begins.
        </p>
        <p style="color:#4b5563;font-size:0.9rem;margin-top:0.5rem;">
          From master-planned neighborhoods near the lake to semi-rural properties with slope, RV parking, and boat storage, we design spaces that respect real drainage, wind, and everyday use.

      <div class="two-col">
        <div>
          <p class="section-subtitle">
            We start with high-fidelity 3D renders—not mood boards or vague sketches. You see what your space will actually look like, not a designer's interpretation.
          </p>
          <h3>Your exact outdoor space, previewed in photo-realistic 3D</h3>
          <p>
            We don't just create loose concepts—we build full 3D renderings of your actual property. You can approve or adjust the design before construction begins, avoiding costly surprises or mid-project changes.
          </p>
          <h3>Every layout begins with real drainage planning</h3>
          <p>
            Lake Havasu City properties—especially hillside and semi-rural lots—often have elevation changes, unpredictable runoff, and drainage challenges. We address grading and water flow before finalizing the design, not as an afterthought.
          </p>
          <h3>Clear proposals with exact scope and materials</h3>
          <p>
            Our proposals specify every material, installation method, and structural detail. You know what you're getting—no gray areas, no vague "we'll figure it out later" language.
          </p>
          <h3>Structures built for extreme desert wind</h3>
          <p>
            Lake Havasu City sees strong gusts year-round. We select pergolas, shade structures, and outdoor fixtures that are designed for high wind loads and install them according to manufacturer or engineered specifications.

    <!-- HOW WE WORK -->
    <section>
      <h2 class="section-title">Our design and build process</h2>
      <p class="section-subtitle">
        We combine 3D visualization, architectural precision, and real-world construction experience to deliver outdoor projects that look exactly like the approved renderings.
      </p>

      <div class="process-grid">
        <div class="process-step">
          <div class="process-number">1</div>
          <h3>Design Questionnaire & Concept Consultation</h3>
          <p>
            You start by completing a design questionnaire that captures your goals, aesthetic preferences, functional requirements, and budget expectations.
          </p>
          <p>
            We review your responses and schedule a project consultation to discuss layout options, drainage considerations, structural features, and design direction.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="process-step">
          <div class="process-number">2</div>
          <h3>3D Rendering & Layout Approval</h3>
          <p>
            We create a high-fidelity 3D rendering of your property with the proposed design. You see exactly what the finished space will look like—including materials, textures, colors, and layout.
          </p>
          <p>
            If adjustments are needed, we revise the rendering until you're completely satisfied with the design direction.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="process-step">
          <div class="process-number">3</div>
          <h3>Architectural Plans & Structural Documentation</h3>
          <p>
            Once the 3D design is approved, we prepare accurate 2D architectural drawings and—when needed—engineered documents for permits, HOA submissions, or structural verification.
          </p>
          <p>
            This includes site plans, elevations, drainage routing, and installation specifications.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="process-step">
          <div class="process-number">4</div>
          <h3>Detailed Proposal & Scope Agreement</h3>
          <p>
            We provide a detailed proposal that includes exact materials, installation methods, and project scope. There are no vague placeholders or "we'll decide later" clauses.
          </p>
          <p>
            You know precisely what you're approving before construction begins.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="process-step">
          <div class="process-number">5</div>
          <h3>Design–Build Management</h3>
          <p>
            We coordinate all aspects of the build—materials, scheduling, inspections, and subcontractor coordination. Communication stays open, timelines remain realistic, and unexpected issues are addressed immediately.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="process-step">
          <div class="process-number">6</div>
          <h3>Final Walkthrough & Handoff</h3>
          <p>
            When the project is complete, we walk through the space with you to confirm that every detail matches the approved design and that all structural, drainage, and installation work meets our standards.

                Often, yes. Many drainage issues stem from poor grading, insufficient slope, trapped low points behind retaining walls, or runoff from uphill properties.
              </p>
              <p>
                If the issue can be solved with grading adjustments, swales, drains, or elevation planning, we will propose a practical solution.

                If the drainage problem is structural or geological in nature, we will be direct about whether it is a project we can safely take on.

                Yes. We select pergola and shade structure models that are appropriate for strong desert winds and install them according to engineered or manufacturer specifications.

                Larger structures, or those placed near property lines, may require permit drawings. We produce these drawings in-house.
