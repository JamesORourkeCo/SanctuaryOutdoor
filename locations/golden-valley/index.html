      <h2 class="section-title">How we design for Golden Valley conditions</h2>
      <p class="section-subtitle">
        Below are some of the engineering and planning considerations that go into a typical Golden Valley
        outdoor living project. You can skim the highlights, then open the sections that matter most to you.
      </p>

      <div class="accordion-group">
        <!-- Drainage -->
        <div class="accordion-item">
          <button class="accordion-header" type="button">
            <span class="label">Drainage & grading in Golden Valley</span>
            <span class="icon">›</span>

          <div class="accordion-content">
            <div class="accordion-inner">
              <p>
                Golden Valley includes both larger rural lots and newer neighborhoods with fully walled yards.
                Rural areas follow natural desert drainage patterns, while walled properties can trap runoff
                if grading isn’t carefully planned.
              </p>
              <p><strong>Rural lots & natural desert flow</strong></p>
              <p>
                On larger properties, we look at how water moves across open ground—where it spreads, where it
                concentrates, and how existing driveways, pads, or outbuildings influence that flow during
                storm events.
              </p>
              <p><strong>Walled yards & localized drainage</strong></p>
              <p>
                In walled neighborhoods, even a small elevation change can create puddling or slow drainage.
                We review elevations, slopes, and wall relationships so new patios, walkways, and landscape
                areas don’t interfere with the way water needs to exit the yard.
              </p>
              <p>
                The goal is simple: integrate drainage strategy into the design from day one so your finished
                outdoor space looks cohesive and performs realistically when it rains.

                Golden Valley sees strong desert winds and sudden storm gusts, especially across open rural
                lots. That means every structure—pergolas, gazebos, patio bars, and shade elements—must be
                treated as more than decoration.
              </p>
              <p>
                At Sanctuary Outdoor, we design outdoor structures with wind performance in mind, even when
                they don’t technically require a permit.
              </p>
              <p><strong>Our wind-resilience standards include:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>Footings sized and placed to handle local wind exposure</li>
                <li>Structural post anchoring with high-grade connectors and fasteners</li>
                <li>Selection of products with appropriate wind ratings where applicable</li>
                <li>Installation practices that respect both product specs and regional best practices</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The end result is an outdoor structure that is designed to look refined but also remain
                functional and safe in the winds Golden Valley is known for.

                Our work in Golden Valley follows a two-part approach: 3D concepts for clarity, and
                architectural-style 2D drawings for precision and pricing.
              </p>
              <p><strong>Phase 1: 3D concept design</strong></p>
              <p>
                We start with photo-realistic 3D images that show your future outdoor space—materials,
                textures, lighting, circulation, and how each area relates to your home and surrounding views.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is where we explore options: pool and spa placement, shade structure locations, outdoor
                kitchens, fire elements, planting concepts, and lighting—all in an environment you can see
                and react to.
              </p>
              <p><strong>Phase 2: Architectural 2D plans</strong></p>
              <p>
                Once the 3D concept is approved, we prepare 2D drawings using professional drafting software.
                These plans include proportional layouts, dimensions, area calculations, construction notes,
                and material indications.
              </p>
              <p>
                The 2D plans are used to develop accurate proposals, guide crews, and support permit
                documentation when needed for certain structures or utilities.
              </p>

              <p><strong>1️⃣ Discovery</strong></p>
              <p>
                We review your property, inspiration, and how you want to live outdoors. In Golden Valley, this
                includes understanding whether your lot is rural, walled, or a mix—and how that affects drainage,
                access, wind exposure, and privacy.
              </p>

              <p><strong>2️⃣ 3D concept design</strong></p>
              <p>
                We translate your goals into a cohesive 3D concept so you can evaluate real visuals instead of
                guessing from simple sketches. Layouts, materials, and focal points are refined until the design
                feels right.
              </p>

              <p><strong>3️⃣ Investment alignment</strong></p>
              <p>
                We connect the design to your budget by building an honest, clearly scoped proposal from the
                approved concept. You’ll see what’s included, what’s not, and where there is room for future phases.
              </p>

              <p><strong>4️⃣ Architectural 2D plans</strong></p>
              <p>
                We prepare 2D drawings that support accurate pricing and installation. These plans show dimensions
                and areas clearly so everyone—from you to the crews on site—knows what is being built.
              </p>

              <p><strong>5️⃣ Design–build management</strong></p>
              <p>
                We manage the build so the finished space matches the 3D vision and the written scope—from layout
                and grading to structures, finishes, and final details.

                We don’t rely on generic “price per square foot” estimates. Instead, we design your space, then
                build a proposal from the approved 3D concept and 2D drawings so the scope and costs line up.
              </p>
              <p>
                Each proposal clearly outlines what will be built, which materials will be used, and what is
                not included. The goal is to avoid scope creep and surprise charges as the project moves forward.

                We provide a realistic timeline for your Golden Valley project based on scope and season.
                Because our work is outdoors, weather is the most common cause of delay.
              </p>
              <p>
                Desert storms, periods of high wind, and saturated ground can all impact safe working conditions.
                These events are not fully predictable, but we communicate clearly when weather alters the schedule
                and resume as soon as it’s safe and practical.

                We work in both. Many of our projects are on larger rural lots with open desert surroundings,
                and we also serve newer Golden Valley neighborhoods with standard-size, walled yards.

              <p>
                Golden Valley is more rural than many nearby communities, and permitting expectations are often
                simpler. Even so, pools and certain structures still need to respect safety, setbacks, and
                utility routes.
              </p>
              <p>
                When needed, we prepare drawings that can support permit documentation and coordinate with your
                pool builder or contractor so the design, layout, and paperwork align.

              <p>
                In many cases, yes. If grading adjustments, swales, or integrated landscape features can improve
                how water moves across your property, we will incorporate those solutions into the design.
              </p>
              <p>
                In situations where upstream grading, neighboring lots, or other constraints limit what can
                realistically be achieved, we’ll be direct about those limitations and whether your project is
                a good fit for our approach.

            <div class="faq-inner">
              <p>
                Yes. We recommend pergolas and shade systems that make sense for Golden Valley’s wind and sun
                exposure, and we install them according to manufacturer instructions so warranties remain valid.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our scope typically includes footing preparation, structural installation, and integration with
                the overall layout shown in the 3D and 2D plans.
              </p>
              <p>
                Larger structures or those close to property lines may require additional review. When needed,
                we can prepare drawings showing how the structure is attached and how it respects setback
                and clearance expectations.
