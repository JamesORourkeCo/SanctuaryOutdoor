      <div class="two-col">
        <div>
          <p class="section-subtitle">
            Golden Valley combines large rural lots with natural desert grading and newer master-planned
            areas surrounded by block walls. Some properties are nearly flat; others sit on gently sloping
            terrain where water spreads widely during storm events.
          </p>
          <p style="font-size:0.9rem;color:#4b5563;">
            Homeowners who choose Sanctuary Outdoor typically want:
          </p>
          <ul style="font-size:0.9rem;color:#4b5563;padding-left:1.1rem;">
            <li>Photo-realistic 3D concepts before any work begins</li>
            <li>Accurate, clearly defined project proposals—no vague allowances</li>
            <li>Drainage solutions that respect natural desert flow and yard layouts</li>
            <li>Wind-rated shade structures that won't fail in high-desert gusts</li>
            <li>Transparent timelines and realistic expectations about weather-related delays</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3 style="font-size:1.2rem;margin-bottom:0.6rem;">Your property, seen in 3D before any build</h3>
          <p style="font-size:0.9rem;color:#4b5563;">
            Our 3D renderings let you see your yard, grading plan, and final outdoor spaces—including
            exact material choices, light direction, and spatial flow—before committing to construction.
          </p>
          <p style="font-size:0.9rem;color:#4b5563;margin-top:0.8rem;">
            We combine that visual clarity with accurate 2D architectural drawings, drainage-aware grading,
            and project proposals that clearly define what is (and is not) included. The result is a
            predictable process with far fewer surprises during the build.

                In many cases, yes. If grading adjustments, swales, or integrated landscape features can improve
                how water moves across your property, we will incorporate those solutions into the design.
              </p>
              <p>
                In situations where upstream grading, neighboring lots, or other constraints limit what can
                realistically be achieved, we'll be direct about those limitations and whether your project is
                a good fit for our approach.

              <p>
                Yes. We recommend pergolas and shade systems that make sense for Golden Valley's wind and sun
                exposure, and we install them according to manufacturer instructions so warranties remain valid.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our scope typically includes footing preparation, structural installation, and integration with
                the overall layout shown in the 3D and 2D plans.
              </p>
              <p>
                Larger structures or those close to property lines may require additional review. When needed,
                we can prepare drawings showing how the structure is attached and how it respects setback
                and clearance expectations.
