      <div class="two-col">
        <div>
          <p class="section-subtitle">
            Fort Mohave includes foothill lots with natural terrain, established neighborhoods with mature landscaping,
            and master-planned communities with HOA requirements. Many properties have elevation changes, block walls,
            or grading constraints that require drainage-aware planning and engineered solutions.
          </p>
          <p style="font-size:0.9rem;color:#4b5563;">
            Homeowners who choose Sanctuary Outdoor typically want:
          </p>
          <ul style="font-size:0.9rem;color:#4b5563;padding-left:1.1rem;">
            <li>Photo-realistic 3D concepts showing their future space before any construction</li>
            <li>Accurate proposals with clearly defined scope and transparent pricing</li>
            <li>Drainage solutions that work with foothill grading and neighborhood flow</li>
            <li>Structures designed for wind and monsoon conditions</li>
            <li>HOA-compliant designs when needed, with supporting documentation</li>
            <li>One team managing design and build from start to finish</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

          <h3 style="font-size:1.2rem;margin-bottom:0.6rem;">Engineered for Fort Mohave conditions</h3>
          <p style="font-size:0.9rem;color:#4b5563;">
            Our 3D renderings show exact materials, lighting, spatial relationships, and grading changes.
            We combine visual clarity with architectural 2D drawings that define dimensions, setbacks,
            and drainage details needed for permitting or HOA review.
          </p>
          <p style="font-size:0.9rem;color:#4b5563;margin-top:0.8rem;">
            The result is a predictable process with accurate pricing, clear timelines, and fewer
            surprises during construction.
